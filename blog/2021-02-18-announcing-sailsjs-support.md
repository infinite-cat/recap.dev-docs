We're happy to announce that one of the popular Node.js frameworks, Sails.js, gets the love it deserves from us. 
And it comes in the form of a [hook that will automatically trace your application](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails-hook-recap-dev).

It means tracing your application with Recap.Dev requires no code changes at all. Just install the hook and point it to your Recap.Dev server.
Why would you do that? Here's [an article](/blog/5-reasons-to-use-recap.dev) giving you five good reasons. 
Basically, it helps you understand your application and how much time various operations took while serving a particular request.
