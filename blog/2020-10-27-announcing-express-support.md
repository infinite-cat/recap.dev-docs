We're happy to announce that starting from version 1.7.0 of [recap.dev JavaScript client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@recap.dev/client) you can fully trace your Express application. 

With the power of async hooks recap.dev traces individual requests and captures its response, request, and an error if there's any. 
Just like our recap.dev for Serverless Framework it will also capture and build a timeline of database queries, HTTP requests, and various SDK calls.
You can also capture logs and enable a function-level tracing to see a timeline of individual function calls.

Adding recap.dev to your application won't take more than 5 minutes.
