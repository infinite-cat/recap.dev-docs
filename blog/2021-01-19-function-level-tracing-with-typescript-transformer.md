We just released a new [recap.dev TypeScript transformer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@recap.dev/ts-transformer) which will automatically wrap your functions and classes with the function-level tracing.

This provides a better alternative for the projects that are compiled with TypeScript compiler or the ts-loader for Webpack eliminating the need for Babel.

Check usage instructions [here](/docs/tracing/function-level-tracing#typescript-transformer)

Adding recap.dev to your application won't take more than 5 minutes.
