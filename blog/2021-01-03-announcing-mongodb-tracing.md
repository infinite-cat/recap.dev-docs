We're happy to announce that starting from version 1.8.2 [recap.dev JavaScript client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@recap.dev/client) will record any MongoDB operations.

Using MongoDB's [Application Performance Monitoring](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.0/reference/management/apm/)
recap.dev will now record all the MongoDB operations happening while handling a request and put it on a timeline. 
It will work if you're using Mongoose ODM or any other package that relies on the `mongodb` npm driver.

Recap.dev client will also record the query and response payloads.

Adding recap.dev to your application won't take more than 5 minutes.
