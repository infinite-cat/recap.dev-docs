Setting a recap.dev tracing up depends on what kind of technology your application is made with.

Here's a list of currently supported technologies:

- [Serverless](/docs/tracing/serverless-application). You can easily trace most of the serverless applications no matter what kind of technology it is made with.
- [ExpressJS](/docs/tracing/express-application). That includes any technologies based on ExpressJS.
- [NestJS](/docs/tracing/nestjs-application). NestJS is based on ExpressJS but recap.dev goes a step further and provides an even deeper integration for the NestJS-based applications.

If your favorite technology is not supported feel free to [contact us](/contact-us) and we'll see what can be done.
