## Introduction 

Recap.dev gathers information of all the things happening when your backend handles a request. That includes:

- **Logs**. Log messages related to the request will be recorded.

- **External resource calls** (databases, APIs) along with timings and request and response payloads. 

- **Function calls** with start and end timings.

It represents the data in a human-friendly way, so it's easy to understand what exactly happened. 
This makes it much easier to find bottlenecks or understand the root cause of an error.
Recap.dev will also build statistics to help you understand the state of your application.

Check the [interactive demo](https://demo.recap.dev/) for more details of how recap.dev represents collected data.

To start using recap.dev you need to do two things:

1. [Start a recap.dev server](/docs/start-server)

2. [Trace your application](/docs/tracing)
